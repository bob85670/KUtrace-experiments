time align commands:
./timealign rpc1.log rpc2.log rpc3.log
./timealign -all rpc1.log rpc2.log rpc3.log

7.1) I do not understand why it is not aligned as expected. The expected 1-2ms gap from between 2 RPC are eliminated.

7.2) I do not understand why postprocessing the server log gives no result.

7.3) I do not understand why postprocessing the server log gives no result.


Concurrency overhead:
- Lock Contention: Threads waiting for shared resources (e.g., key-value store) due to lock acquisition delays.
- Context Switching: CPU switching between threads from frequent state saves/restores.
- Memory Contention: Threads competing for RAM bandwidth
- Queueing Delays: Busy threads cause operation queues
- Thread Synchronization: Coordinating threads via mutexes/signaling
