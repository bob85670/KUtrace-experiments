10.1) 50ms is the expected server latency for birthday request and 100ms dealine may reflect that one server has crushed and another server handles the request.

if three requests all arrive within the same 50ms intervals, the latter request will wait for previous request to access the disk thus have longer server latency. The third request are likely to not meet its deadline.

To calculuate Prob(3 request in 50ms, given an average rate of 60 requests/minute):
lambda = 60 * (50/60000) = 0.05 requests
P(3) = (lambda^3 * e^(-lambda)) / 3!    (it is the poisson pmf)
     = 1.98 * 10^(-5)

The expected deadline missed in a day = 10000 * 1.98 * 10^(-5) = 0.198
