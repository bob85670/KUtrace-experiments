There is an abnormal 4KB transfer group which involves mulitple core activities. I estimate that it is a hardware interrupt from unrelated device.

The truth is it is a system-wide kernel maintenance event --- multi-core timer interrupt storm triggered by a global or broadcast IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt) event , with local APIC timer vectors firing near-simultaneously across all 4 cores, followed by normal ssd interrupt routine in core 2. 

This leads the I/O thread on Core 2 runs 11us, 2x longer time needed for other normal ssd interrupt.

The purpose of this kernel maintenance event on core 0 is to do a global timekeeping, scheduler load-balancing, and RCU (Read-Copy Update) synchronization to avoid the grace period problem.

No need to fix this.
