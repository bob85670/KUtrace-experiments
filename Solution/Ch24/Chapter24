Notes: 
- number of I/O operations = total pages in chunk / (standard page size on x86-64 * number of pages in a group)
- 1KB = 1024B, 1MB = 1024^2 B, 1GB = 1024^3 B
- Linux use readahead/prefetching when handling page faults in sequential access pattern. 
- malloc prefetch 8 pages, mmap prefetches 128-256 pages

24.1) improves. (40 * 1024 * 1024) / (4096 * 16) = 640 I/O operations per 40MB. 50% less I/Os

24.2) best. (40 * 1024 * 1024) / (4096 * 128) = 78 I/O operations per 40MB. 16x fewer I/Os than 8-page. And it matches modern SSD storage block size and avold wasted reads. (for example when the OS request 8 pages, it asks to read 32KB and SSD reads 512KB internally, 480KB is wasted)

24.3) to avoid thrashing (fetched useful but unused pages), reduce RAM presure(prefetching uses RAM) and reduce cache pollution (most program access memory randomly and sequential prefetch may pollution the caches).
